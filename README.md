### 📈 AI Stock Prediction Agent
XGBoost + LSTM Ensemble for Next-Day Market Direction

An interactive AI-powered stock movement prediction app built with Streamlit, combining XGBoost (tabular ML) and LSTM (deep learning for sequences) to forecast whether a stock is likely to go UP 📈 or DOWN 📉 tomorrow.

## 🚀 Live App Features

✔ Download 3 years of historical stock data from Yahoo Finance
✔ Feature engineering using rolling return windows
✔ Dual-model prediction system:

## 🌲 XGBoost for tabular learning

🧠 LSTM Neural Network for time-series pattern learning
✔ Ensemble probability-based trading signal
✔ Visual stock performance chart
✔ Model validation using ROC-AUC

## 🧠 How the Model Works

1️⃣ Data Processing

Historical stock prices are downloaded using yfinance

Daily returns are calculated

Future return is used to create a classification target

A threshold removes noisy small movements

2️⃣ Feature Engineering
For each day, the model uses the previous N days' returns (Window Size) as features.

Lag Feature	Meaning
ret_lag_1	Yesterday’s return
ret_lag_2	Return 2 days ago
...	...
ret_lag_N	Return N days ago

3️⃣ Models Used

🌲 XGBoost Classifier
Learns nonlinear relationships in tabular lag-return features.

## 🧠 LSTM Neural Network
Learns temporal patterns from sequences of stock returns.

4️⃣ Ensemble Prediction

Final Probability = 0.6 × XGBoost + 0.4 × LSTM

Probability	Signal
> 0.60	📈 BUY
< 0.40	📉 SELL
0.40 – 0.60	⏸ HOLD

## 📊 Model Validation

Performance is evaluated using ROC-AUC on a TimeSeriesSplit validation strategy.

This avoids data leakage and simulates real trading conditions.

## 🖥 App Interface

🔍 User Inputs

Stock symbol (Yahoo Finance format, e.g. AAPL, TSLA, RELIANCE.NS)

Window size for historical lookback

📈 Outputs
